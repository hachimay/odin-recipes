        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <p> Makes 8 servings</p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 envelopes unflavored gelatine</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups skim-milk yogurt</li>
            <li>1 cup low-calorie mayo</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chili sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped green onion</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried tarragon leaves</li>
            <li>2 lb shelled de-veined shrimp, cooked</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped celery</li>
            <li>lettuce</li>
        </ul>  

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle gelatine over 1 1/2 cups cold water in medium saucepan; let soften about 5 minutes. Bring to boil, stirring until gelative is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Set pan in bowl of ice cubes until gelatine is cold; stir once or twice.</li>
            <li>Add yogurt, mayo, chili sauce, lemon juice, onion, salt, and tarragon to gelatine; mix until well blended. Refrigerate or place over ice, stirring occasionally, until mixture is consistency of unbeaten egg whites.</li>
            <li>Set aside and refrigerate 8 shrimp for garnish. Cut remaining shrimp in 1/4 inch pieces. Add chopped shrimp and celery to yogurt mixture; mix well. Turn into chilled, 2-quart mold or 8 individual molds.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate until set- about 6 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>To unmold: Run a small spatula around the edge of the mold, then dip the mold in warm water for a few seconds. Place onto a bed of lettuce and garnish edge with shrimp.</li>

        </ol>
